nanoc compiles the markdown in 2 steps:

  1. the markdown is converted to HTML (using kramdown, 
     which is specified in the Rules file) 

  2. the HTML partials are then injected into a
     layout (that is again specified in the Rules 
     file) to produce a complete HTML page 
  
This page captures step #1 (pre layout snapshot)
for each chapter. The result is a single HTML page 
containing all of the chapters which is then 
converted to a PDF.
